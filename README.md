Undertaking paper replication: 'Learning to Solve NP-Complete Problems - A Graph Neural Network for Decision TSP' with PyTorch.

## Overview
This project aims to replicate the research findings presented in the paper "Learning to Solve NP-Complete Problems - A Graph Neural Network for Decision TSP" using PyTorch. The original paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in solving the decision variant of the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), a highly relevant NP-complete problem.
