## Overview
This project aims to replicate the research findings presented in the paper "Learning to Solve NP-Complete Problems - A Graph Neural Network for Decision TSP" using PyTorch. The original paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in solving the decision variant of the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), a highly relevant NP-complete problem.

In contrast to the original work, which utilized the [Concorde TSP solver](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html) to generate supervised data, this replication employs [Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization) for generating dataset updates. Leveraging Google OR-Tools offers advantages in terms of speed and efficiency, enabling faster experimentation and iteration in the research process.
